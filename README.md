Instruction to run the build :

1. Please find the source code in the Git repository : 
https://github.com/ThangamKumar/nCino.git

2. Download as Zip folder.

3. Please make your all the setup (Chrome, TestNg, Maven) with proper versions.

4. Import the packages to the local device

5. Click on Run/Execute "testng.xml" file to execute the code for the desired output.
 

Points to note:

1. Since we have simple test cases to excute I have hard coded the test data and url instead of using config.property file.
2. In the scenario 2, for editing the to do item have used 'action class' to edit the given data. However, we can acheive the same using 'clear' method/function.
